Additionally, the phrase ""يساعد على تلبيه الاحتياجات"" translates to ""it helps meet requirements,"" which suggests that the reviewer is happy with how well the program meets their needs.

4220,التطبيق لا يغتح دائما بيعطيني لا يوجد اتصال بالشبكة..مع انه النت عندي تمام شو الحل??,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review expresses frustration and disappointment towards a mobile application. The user is stating that the app often fails to connect them to the network, despite their best efforts (""لا يوجد اتصال بالشبكة""), which implies a sense of failure or inadequacy on the part of the app.

The use of the phrase ""مع انه النت عندي تمام"" (meaning ""but I have complete internet access"") suggests that the user has a stable and functional internet connection, yet the app still fails to connect them to it. This highlights the app's inability to fulfill its basic functionality, leading to a negative sentiment.

The final question mark (""الشو الحل??"") at the end of the sentence implies uncertainty or frustration, leaving the reader wondering what could be the solution to this problem, which further emphasizes the user's dissatisfaction with the app's performance.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

4221,لماذا لا يمكننا طلب من ماكدونالدز؟,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON: The review contains a rhetorical question, ""لماذا لا يمكننا طلب من ماكدونالدز؟"", which translates to ""Why can't we ask McDonald's?"" in English. In the context of the Arab world, particularly in countries where McDonald's has a significant presence, this question suggests frustration and disappointment towards the company.

In modern Arab societies, it is common for citizens to criticize Western fast-food chains like McDonald's for their perceived cultural imperialism and lack of understanding of local tastes and preferences. The question itself implies that there are valid reasons why locals should not be asking McDonald's for something, likely implying a sense of exclusion or marginalization.

Furthermore, the tone of the review is inquiring but also somewhat accusatory, suggesting that McDonald's has failed to understand or respect the needs and expectations of Arab customers. This sentiment is characteristic of negative reviews, which often express dissatisfaction or criticism towards a product or service.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

4222,البرنامج بيظهر كل المطاعم و مغلقه مع انها بتكون فاتحه بقاله كده اكتر من شهر,-1,talbat,NEUTRAL,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON: The review expresses a neutral sentiment towards the program that displays and closes restaurants.

4223,أصبح غالي جداً,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review ""أصبح غالي جداً"" (which translates to ""It has become very expensive"") expresses a negative sentiment. The word ""غالي"" (galy) is an adjective that means ""expensive"" or ""costly"", and when combined with the phrase ""جداً"" (jeda), which means ""very"" or ""extremely"", it emphasizes the high cost.

In Arabic culture, being considered ""ghali"" can be perceived as a negative connotation, implying that something is no longer affordable or reasonable. In this context, the reviewer likely uses the word to express dissatisfaction or disappointment with the price of something, possibly a product or service.

The tone of the review suggests a sense of regret or frustration, as if the reviewer had expected something to be more reasonably priced. The negative sentiment is conveyed through the use of a strong adjective and a emphatic particle (""جداً""), which amplifies the meaning of the word.

Overall, the reviewer's statement implies that the price has increased significantly, making it unaffordable or unreasonable, leading to a negative emotional response.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review is written in Arabic, and upon analyzing the text, it appears to be a enthusiastic expression of praise. The word ""جميل"" (jamil) means ""beautiful"" or ""good-looking"", but in this context, it is used as an adjective to describe something as exceptionally pleasing or impressive.

4226,برنامج توترز توصيل احلى من برنامجكم فاشل,-1,talbat,POSITIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON: The review starts by mentioning that the program offers ""احلى"" (a phrase meaning ""the best"" or ""taste the best""), which could imply a positive sentiment. However, the reviewer immediately adds that it is actually called ""برنامج توترز توصيل"" which translates to ""Towers Delivery Program"", implying that the review might be about something unrelated or unexpected.

Moreover, when the reviewer states that this program is ""فاشل"" (failed), it's unclear whether they are referring to a specific incident or a general disappointment. The use of the word ""فاشل"" without additional context makes it challenging to determine whether the sentiment is purely negative, slightly disappointed, or even sarcastic.

Given these nuances and the lack of explicit information about what specifically went wrong with the program, the overall tone can be classified as neutral.

REASON:

The review expresses a strongly negative sentiment towards the app. Although some aspects, such as free delivery and competitive prices, are mentioned positively, they do not outweigh the overall negative tone of the review.

The phrase ""اسعارهم اغلا من المحلات ب كثير"" suggests that the prices are too high compared to other stores, which indicates dissatisfaction with the app's pricing strategy.

However, the most significant contributor to the negative sentiment is the final sentence: ""حكي فاضي التطبيق لا انصح به"", which translates to ""this fake application does not recommend it"". The use of the word ""حكي"" (fake) implies that the reviewer believes the app is misleading or deceitful in some way, and the phrase ""لا انصح به"" (does not recommend it) reinforces this negative sentiment.

REASON:

The review ""التطيبق لايعمل بغداد"" can be translated to ""The Iraqi government does not work."" However, the tone and context of the statement suggest a sense of optimism and hope for change.

In Arabic culture, the phrase ""ليس للعقل أن يعتقد أحد"" translates to ""No one should believe someone else,"" but in this context, it seems to be used humorously or ironically.

In essence, the reviewer is expressing skepticism about the government's ability to function effectively, but with a hint of positivity and optimism. They are suggesting that even in the midst of chaos and dysfunction, there is always the potential for change or improvement. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the review seems to be more focused on the idea of hope for better days ahead rather than outright condemnation.

REASON: This review is negative because the customer expresses frustration and disappointment towards a salesperson who promised discounts on their first three purchases, but failed to provide them.

The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly positive. The word ""جيد"" conveys a strong sense of approval and appreciation for whatever is being described (in this case, likely the restaurant or service). There are no negative or mixed sentiments expressed in this review.

REASON:

The review ""الضريبه عالية جداً"" can be translated to ""the price is very high."" In the context of Arabic culture and language, the word ""ضريبة"" (draibe) has a specific connotation that implies value or quality. When someone says that something has ""ضريبة عالية جدًا,"" they are essentially saying that the item has a high level of value or quality.

In this case, the reviewer is implying that the item in question has an exceptionally high value or quality, which suggests a positive sentiment. The use of the word ""جداً"" (jeda), which means ""very"" or ""extremely,"" reinforces this notion, as it emphasizes the magnitude of the reviewer's praise.

In Arabic culture, expressing admiration for someone or something often involves using superlatives and emphasizing their exceptional qualities. Therefore, when a reviewer says that an item has ""الضريبة عالية جدًا,"" they are essentially saying that it is outstanding, superior, or remarkable – all of which convey a positive sentiment.

REASON:

The review is a mix of phrases that convey frustration and disappointment, but also contain elements of acceptance and resignation. The reviewer starts by expressing gratitude (""الحمدلله"") for being able to communicate with the authorities responsible for their request, which implies a positive sentiment.

However, they then express disappointment and frustration with the situation, stating that someone made an error with an excessive amount (""مبلغ المنتج اللي جه غلط"") and uses phrases like ""زوق زياده"" (a colloquialism meaning ""extra"" or ""excessive"") to emphasize their dissatisfaction.

REASON:

The review is a mix of phrases that convey frustration and disappointment, but also contain elements of acceptance and resignation. The reviewer starts by expressing gratitude (""الحمدلله"") for being able to communicate with the authorities responsible for their request, which implies a positive sentiment.

However, they then express disappointment and frustration with the situation, stating that someone made an error with an excessive amount (""مبلغ المنتج اللي جه غلط"") and uses phrases like ""زوق زياده"" (a colloquialism meaning ""extra"" or ""excessive"") to emphasize their dissatisfaction. The reviewer also mentions being ""الجبنه"" (the servant) which implies a sense of powerlessness and lack of control.

REASON:

The given review is written in Arabic and seems to be expressing frustration or disappointment. However, upon closer analysis, it appears that the sentiment is not strongly negative.

The phrase ""شيء بخزي"" translates to ""something embarrassing"" or ""a shameful thing,"" which suggests that something was done awkwardly or with a lack of consideration. The speaker mentions that they waited for their turn (""ساعه أستنى طلب"") and then had something unexpected happen (""اخر شيء كتبولي طلب إلغى"").

The key phrase ""الآخر شيء كتبولي طلب إلغى"" implies that the speaker's request was cancelled unexpectedly, which is a neutral or even slightly negative sentiment. However, the use of the word ""بخزي"" to describe this situation suggests embarrassment rather than anger or strong frustration.

Furthermore, the review does not contain any strongly emotive language or personal attacks, which further supports the classification as neutral. The tone seems more annoyed and disappointed than angry or upset.

Overall, while the sentiment in this review is somewhat negative, it can be characterized as neutral due to the lack of strong emotions and the use of a relatively mild word like ""بخزي"" to describe the situation.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON: The review ""معظم المطاعم يتعذر التوصيل لها"" can be translated to ""Most restaurants are difficult to reach.""

The use of the word ""يعذر"" (it's difficult) implies that the reviewer found it challenging to get in touch with or access most restaurants, which suggests frustration and disappointment.

In Arabic culture, being able to easily contact or reach someone is considered an important aspect of social interaction and business relationships. The fact that many restaurants are difficult to reach could indicate poor customer service, lack of responsiveness, or inadequate communication channels, all of which can lead to negative experiences for customers.

Furthermore, the use of the word ""معظم"" (most) emphasizes the widespread nature of the problem, implying that it's not just an isolated issue but rather a common challenge faced by many people.

In the context of online reviews, where customers rate products or services, a positive sentiment is conveyed by using the word ""رائع"", which implies satisfaction and approval.

In Arabic culture, the prefix ""رائع"" is an intensifier that amplifies the meaning of the following adjective. Therefore, when used to describe an application, it reinforces the idea that the app is not just good, but exceptional or outstanding. This use of language suggests that the reviewer has had a very positive experience with the application and recommends it to others.

Additionally, in online reviews, using the word ""رائع"" instead of simply stating ""جيد"" (good) implies a higher level of enthusiasm and approval.

REASON:

The review ""لا يعمل بسبب انتظر رمز"" can be translated to ""It doesn't work because of waiting for the code"". The sentiment behind this review is negative, and here's a detailed explanation in English.

The use of the phrase ""لا يعمل"" (doesn't work) immediately conveys a sense of disappointment or frustration. In Arabic culture, where politeness and respect are highly valued, using such direct language may suggest that the reviewer feels let down by the product or service.

Furthermore, the review mentions waiting for a code as the reason for the issue. The word ""انتظر"" (waiting) implies a sense of patience and anticipation, which is often expected from customers when dealing with technical issues. However, in this case, the fact that the reviewer had to wait for a code suggests that the product or service was not able to handle their needs efficiently.

Additionally, the phrase ""لا يعمل"" can be perceived as stronger than simply saying ""the product didn't work"". This may indicate that the reviewer's experience was more severe or frustrating than they initially let on. The use of the negative sentence structure and the absence of any mitigating language (e.g., apologies, attempts to help) further emphasizes the negative sentiment.

Overall, while the review is brief, it conveys a strong sense of disappointment and frustration with the product or service, leading me to classify it as negative.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review appears to be a mix of opinions and statements, making it challenging to categorize as purely positive or negative. However, upon closer analysis, the overall tone can be described as neutral.

The reviewer mentions two separate situations: one where the product is being carried in its original box (خالص عل 3اجهزه), and another where it's not (راجي يحمل نهءي).

However, they also mention that this change is not always appreciated by customers (""أمر يفتقر إلى تقدير لمستخدم طلبات""). This suggests that while there may be some benefits to the new policy, it's not universally well-received.

The reviewer then mentions several positive aspects of their experience, including:

* ""التواصل بسرعة"" (quick communication) with the company

* ""التواصل بسرعة"" (quick communication) with the company
* ""حل الموضوع"" (resolving the issue)
* ""التعويض اذا حصل مشكلة"" (compensation if there's a problem)

These points suggest that the reviewer has had generally positive interactions with the company.

However, they also mention two negative aspects:

* The price of the delivery service is not competitive (""سعر التوصيل التطبيقات الثانية أقل سعر"")
* Sometimes, there is no delivery fee (أحيانا بدون سعر توصيل)

These points suggest that the reviewer feels the company's pricing strategy is not optimal.

Overall, the review is neutral because it highlights both positive and negative aspects of the reviewer's experience. While they seem to appreciate the quick communication and resolution of issues, they also express concerns about the price and delivery fees. The tone of the review is polite and appreciative, but also critical, which suggests a neutral sentiment overall.","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following issues or problems mentioned in Arabic:\n\nPolicy change for customer requests', 'undervaluation of customer orders (in contrast to normal)', 'sometimes no delivery charge is applied.\n\nTranslated and listed in English', 'these issues are: Policy change for customer requests', 'Undervaluation of customer orders', 'No delivery charge applied sometimes.']","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following positive aspects:\n\nQuick response and resolution of customer issues.\nFast and efficient communication with customers.\nPrompt resolution of problems and compensation for any inconvenience.\n\nNote: The phrase ""شكرا طلبات"" at the end is a polite expression that translates to ""thank you customers"".']","['Here are the suggestions translated to English and listed in a comma-separated format:\n\nImprove customer service', 'Offer second application with lower price', 'sometimes without delivery fee.\n\nNote: The review is in Arabic', 'but it appears that the customer is suggesting improvements for a food delivery or ordering app', 'possibly similar to Uber Eats or Foodpanda.']"

The review ""لايدعم العراق"" is a single Arabic word that translates to ""I don't support Iraq"". However, the context of the review might be different. In Arabic culture, saying ""لايدعم العراق"" can have different implications depending on who says it and why.

If someone from Iraq or someone close to them says ""لايدعم العراق"", it's likely they are expressing concern or disappointment about a situation affecting their country, family, or community. The sentiment in this case would be neutral, as the speaker is not necessarily supporting or opposing something specific, but rather sharing their feelings of uncertainty or worry.

On the other hand, if someone from outside Iraq says ""لايدعم العراق"", it might imply that they are expressing support for a particular group or ideology within Iraq. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this is the case.

REASON: The review ""فيو احتيل"" (Vio Hatile) is a negative sentiment because it is an exclamation of disappointment or frustration. In Arabic, the word ""حتيل"" (hatile) can be translated to English as ""I hated it"" or ""I was disappointed."" When used in this context, it implies that the reviewer had a strongly unfavorable experience with Vio.

In general, when someone uses the phrase ""لا أحبها"" (la habha), which means ""I don't like her,"" they are expressing strong dislike. Similarly, when Vio is followed by ""احتيل,"" it conveys a sense of disappointment or frustration. This phrase suggests that the reviewer had a negative experience with Vio, and their tone is one of discontent.

REASON:

The review consists of two hand gestures, 👍 (a thumbs up) and 👏 (a round of applause), which are commonly used to express approval or appreciation. However, the absence of any explicit text or commentary makes it difficult to discern a specific sentiment.

In Arabic culture, a single gesture can convey a range of emotions and intentions, depending on the context in which it is used. Thumbs up 👍 can be used to express agreement or approval, while round of applause 👏 can indicate enthusiasm or celebration.

Given the lack of explicit text, it's challenging to determine whether this review is intended to be positive, negative, or neutral.

The review consists of two hand gestures, 👍 (a thumbs up) and 👏 (a round of applause), which are commonly used to express approval or appreciation. However, the absence of any explicit text or commentary makes it difficult to discern a specific sentiment.

The use of the word ""ممتAZE"" (excellent) to describe the service implies a strong positive sentiment. In Arabic, ""ممتاز"" is an adjective that carries a sense of superiority or high quality.

The review ""كثير العلانات على فاضي طورو حالكم"" can be translated to ""There are many speculations about your current situation."" The tone of the sentence is neutral, as it simply states a fact without expressing any emotion or opinion.

In Arabic culture, the word ""فاضي"" (fāḥīz) has a connotation that implies something is uncertain, ambiguous, or lacking in clarity. However, when used in this context, it seems to be describing the current situation of someone, rather than making an assertion about its nature.

The use of the phrase ""كثير العلانات"" (kathir al-'uqūl) also suggests that there are many opinions or speculations being discussed about the person's current situation.

The reviewer then says ""لو فيه أقل من نجمة كمان"" which means ""even if there were fewer than one star"". The use of ""كمان"" (also) is used to add emphasis on the previous statement. This implies that even with a low rating, the reviewer still thinks the property is bad.

The word ""احسن"" (best) is used in an ironic or sarcastic tone, implying that nothing about the property makes it good. The use of all capital letters for repeated words (""اسعارة"", ""خراب"") conveys strong emotions and exaggeration, adding to the negative sentiment.

REASON:

The review expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the restaurant. Here's a breakdown of the emotions conveyed:

* The word ""فاشل"" (failed) implies that the reviewer expected something to happen or be done, but it didn't meet their expectations.
* The phrase ""٣ ساعات"" (3 hours) suggests that the reviewer waited for an extended period, which is often associated with frustration and disappointment.
* The phrase ""مهمل طلبي"" (disregard for my request) implies that the restaurant staff did not take the reviewer's complaint seriously or showed disrespect towards them.
* The word ""حجه"" (excuse) implies that the reviewer felt justified in leaving, as if they had a legitimate reason to do so.
* However, the phrase ""ان المطعم زحمه"" (the restaurant burdened me) can be interpreted in different ways. While it could mean that the reviewer was forced or overwhelmed by the restaurant's demands, in this context, it seems more likely that the reviewer is complaining about being overworked and underappreciated.

REASON:

The review is a collection of Arabic characters and words that, when translated and analyzed, reveal a complex emotional tone. At first glance, the text appears to be nonsensical or even gibberish due to the lack of punctuation and grammatical structure.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the reviewer is expressing frustration or disappointment with something (although the exact subject is unclear without further context).

The use of the Arabic character ڈ (daleeh) at the beginning of the review suggests a sense of surprise or questioning. The repetition of this character and other Arabic words, such as ة (alif) and ؟ (question mark), implies a sense of inquiry or seeking answers.

Furthermore, the reviewer's repeated use of the phrase ""ةةةة"" (three alifs) can be interpreted as an expression of exasperation or exaggeration. This is reinforced by the inclusion of other words like ""ة ?"" (a question mark with an ""alif"" attached), which suggests a sense of bewilderment.

However, it's essential to note that the tone of this review is not overtly negative or angry. Instead, it seems to be more of a confused or disheartened expression. The reviewer appears to be searching for answers or seeking clarification on an issue but may be unable to articulate their concerns effectively due to language barriers.

The phrase ""مشاللة"" means ""problem"" or ""issue,"" indicating that the reviewer has found something amiss with the app. However, instead of using more severe language, they use ""موبي"" (mo'bay) to refer to the app's developers, implying that they are not aware or understanding of the issue.

The tone is informal and slightly annoyed, but it's directed at a specific aspect of the app rather than a blanket statement about its quality. The reviewer does not use strong language or personal attacks, which suggests a neutral sentiment.

Furthermore, the reviewer's use of colloquial Arabic phrases adds to the sense of familiarity and casualness in their criticism. This tone is more likely to be used by someone familiar with the app and its target audience, rather than an angry or hostile critic.

Overall, while the review expresses frustration with a specific issue, it remains neutral due to the lack of strong language and personal attacks, as well as the focus on a specific problem rather than making a general attack.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

The brevity and simplicity of the review suggest that the reviewer may have been trying to convey a strong sense of disappointment or frustration, which is consistent with a negative sentiment.

In Arabic culture, where politeness and tact are highly valued, a straightforward expression like ""تطبيق بطيء ولايعمل"" would be seen as blunt and impolite.

However, without further information or any explicit statement regarding the subject matter, one can only make an educated guess based on this visual representation alone.

REASON: The review ""الموظفين لايردو على استفسارات"" is written in Arabic and translates to ""The employees ignored inquiries"". At first glance, it may seem like a negative sentiment. However, upon closer analysis, I believe that the tone of the review is neutral.

In Arabic culture, ""لايردو"" can be translated to mean ""ignoring"", but it also carries a connotation of something being forgotten or overlooked, rather than deliberately dismissed. The use of the plural form ""الموظفين"" (employees) suggests that the reviewer is discussing a situation where multiple employees ignored inquiries, which could imply a systemic issue rather than a personal attack on individual employees.

Furthermore, the sentence structure and word choice used in the review suggest a neutral tone. There is no emotional language or strong sentiment expressed, which is often characteristic of negative reviews. The review appears to be stating a fact or observation rather than expressing a opinion or emotion.

Overall, while the review does convey a sense of disappointment or frustration, I believe that the tone is more neutral than negative due to its focus on describing an issue rather than criticizing individuals or the organization as a whole.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

Therefore, based on the language and tone used, it can be concluded that the reviewer's sentiment towards the delivery service in Oman is negative.","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following issues:\n\nDelivery failure in Oman.\n\n(Note: The review is written in Arabic and mentions ""افشل ديليفري"" which means ""delivery failed"" or ""delivery not successful""', 'indicating a problem with delivery.)']","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following positive aspects in English', 'separated by commas:\n\nDelivery efficiency improved', 'customer satisfaction increased', 'service reliability enhanced.\n\nTranslation notes:\n\n- ""افشل ديليفري في عُمان"" roughly translates to ""Deliveries failed in Oman"".

4334,خائب لا يضم مطاعم مهمة وأسعار مرتفعة,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review is a simple sentence consisting of two words, ""خائب"" and ""لا يضم مطاعم مهمة وأسعار مرتفعة"". The word ""خائب"" translates to ""empty"" or ""void"", while the phrase ""لا يضم مطاعم مهمة"" translates to ""does not contain important restaurants"". The final phrase ""أسعار مرتفعة"" means ""high prices"".

The sentiment of this review is negative because it implies that the establishment (likely a restaurant) has no significant or notable options, and the prices are excessively high. The reviewer seems to be expressing disappointment or frustration with their experience.

In Arabic culture, where social relationships and hospitality are highly valued, the lack of quality dining options at an establishment can be seen as a failure to provide basic necessities for customers. Additionally, high prices without corresponding value can lead to resentment among consumers.

Overall, the review suggests that the reviewer had low expectations and was disappointed with their experience, leading me to classify it as a negative sentiment.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

The review expresses a positive sentiment towards the application, stating that it is ""جميل جدا"" (very beautiful) and occasionally provides ""كوبونات خصم"" (discount coupons).

By describing the application as ""جميل جدا"", the reviewer implies that it has a visually appealing interface, which suggests that the app is well-designed and easy to use.

4336,قال حسيتو تضايق من صعصغغغعععععععععغ في عدد غغغفغععه,0,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review is written in Arabic, and the text appears to be a sarcastic or ironic expression. The word ""حسيتو"" (I felt) is used in a way that suggests the opposite of what it would normally convey. In this case, the speaker is likely expressing a sense of relief or amusement at someone else's distress.

The phrase ""ضايق من صعصغغعععععععععغ"" can be translated to English as ""I felt embarrassed by the loudness"" or ""I was mortified by the noise."" However, given the context and the tone of the sentence, it is more likely that the speaker is being facetious. The use of repetition (""غ"" repeated multiple times) adds a layer of sarcasm, implying that the speaker finds the situation comical.

In Arabic culture, expressing embarrassment or mortification is not typically done in such an exaggerated manner, especially when discussing someone else's behavior. Therefore, the tone of the sentence suggests that the reviewer is being tongue-in-cheek, likely mocking someone else for their loudness. This interpretation aligns with a negative sentiment, as it implies that the speaker finds the situation annoying or amusing at someone else's expense.

It's worth noting that without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact target of the speaker's sarcasm (whether it's a person, a place, or an object). However, based on the language and tone used, it is reasonable to conclude that the sentiment is negative.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

However, the phrase ""الطلب يتأخر عده مرات"" (the request takes many times to be fulfilled) introduces a negative note to the review. The use of the word ""تأخر"" (delays) implies that there was an expectation of quick service or timely fulfillment of requests, but this expectation was not met.

The combination of these two elements in the same review suggests a nuanced sentiment that is neither entirely positive nor entirely negative.

The given review ""سيئ ضحكو على الشوفريه يالسياره"" can be translated to English as ""Bad joke on the driver, oh car."" This sentiment is negative towards the speaker's experience or interaction with someone (likely a taxi driver) while using a vehicle.

Breaking it down:

- ""سيئ"" translates to ""bad,"" indicating that something was not satisfactory.
- ""ضحكو"" refers to a joke or a pun. However, the context suggests that the speaker finds this attempt at humor ""bad"" rather than appreciating it.
- ""علي الشوفريه"" means ""on the driver"" or ""about the driver."" This implies that the speaker's dissatisfaction is directed towards the person driving (in this case, possibly a taxi driver).
- ""يالسياره"" translates to ""oh car,"" but in this context, it seems more like an exasperated sigh rather than a genuine expression of concern for the vehicle itself.

Overall, the reviewer is expressing discontent and frustration with a particular interaction they had while using a service (likely a taxi), indicating a negative sentiment towards the experience.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review ""كيف يمكن استرداد القسائم المنتهية"" translates to ""How can I get back the overdue payments?"" and has a negative sentiment.

In Arabic, the question prefix ""كيف"" (how) is often used with a sense of frustration or inquiry, implying that something undesirable or problematic has occurred. In this context, the reviewer is inquiring about how to recover from an unfortunate situation - likely being charged late fees or penalties for overdue payments.

The use of the word ""استرداد"" (recovery) also carries a negative connotation, as it implies a loss or a debt that needs to be rectified. The reviewer's question suggests that they are experiencing difficulties and are seeking assistance or guidance on how to resolve the issue.

Furthermore, the review is phrased in a questioning manner, which adds to the overall sense of frustration and concern. This suggests that the reviewer is unhappy with their current situation and is looking for help to recover from it.

REASON:

The sentiment of this review is negative towards the program or software being referred to, likely a educational or training program. The reviewer expresses disappointment and frustration with the product's poor quality, stating that it was not up to par with their expectations.

The use of Arabic phrases such as ""للأسف"" (which translates to ""regretfully"" or ""unfortunately"") at the beginning of the review sets a negative tone. The reviewer then elaborates on the issues they encountered, including problems with the program's loading speed and poor material quality.

What is most striking about this review is that the reviewer has a deep understanding of the program's capabilities and limitations, as evidenced by their mention of a similar successful program that was implemented in Saudi Arabia for 10 years. This comparison serves to highlight the shortcomings of the current program even more starkly.

The reviewer's use of emotive language, such as ""فشل فشل ذريع"" (which translates to ""swift and total failure""), emphasizes their strong dissatisfaction with the product. Additionally, the fact that they were met with only an apology from a representative rather than any concrete solutions or explanations for the issues they faced adds to their negative sentiment.

REASON: The reviewer expresses frustration and disappointment with their experience at the store. They mention that they have occasionally found a discount section (خانة الخصومات), but it is often empty (غالبا غائبا) or misleading (تقالون ان عندي كوبونات لكن الخانة مختفية). This suggests that the reviewer feels misled and deceived by the store's claims of available discounts. The phrase ""ارجو اصلاح هذه المشكلة"" implies a desire for the issue to be resolved, but the tone is critical and negative, indicating overall dissatisfaction with their experience.

REASON:

The given review is written in Arabic and translates to ""Deceivers have fallen into the trap of the driver's car, blessed be God upon you all"". 

In this context, the reviewer uses a strong negative tone towards the driver. The word ""مخادعين"" (mukhadinin) means ""deceitful"" or ""deceivers"", which implies that the reviewer believes the driver is dishonest or fraudulent.

REASON:

The review ""زباااله"" is a single Arabic word that consists of the letter ""ه"" with no vowels. In Arabic, words without vowels are called ""mismal"" (مسمال), which can have different meanings depending on their context and pronunciation.

In this case, the lack of vowels makes it difficult to determine the exact meaning of the review. However, considering the structure and simplicity of the word, I would argue that it is likely intended to convey a neutral or absent sentiment. The word ""زباااله"" has no inherent negative connotation, and its brevity suggests a lack of strong emotional attachment.

Furthermore, if we were to consider possible interpretations based on Arabic language conventions, words without vowels are often used to express the absence or negation of something (e.g., ""لا"" meaning ""no"" or ""هام"" meaning ""important"" without vowels). Given these possibilities, I would classify the sentiment of this review as neutral, indicating either the absence of a meaningful comment or an expression of neutrality.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON:

The review expresses strong dissatisfaction and frustration towards the service provided by the restaurant. The reviewer starts with a phrase that is often used to caution someone against being too proud or arrogant (""هين قرشك ولا تهين نفسك"", which translates to ""Don't be so proud, you're not so good""), implying that they had high expectations for their experience but were disappointed.

The reviewer then explicitly states that the service was ""sour"" (تعامل سئ) when dealing with customers, specifically mentioning that this is a common problem in restaurants (""لما تجي تستلم طلبك""). This suggests that the reviewer feels that the restaurant's staff is not treating customers fairly or with respect.

Furthermore, the reviewer sarcastically implies that they should have been treated as if they were the son of their ""father"" (علاوي أيش على 300 بيسه توفير), a phrase that can be interpreted as a veiled insult towards the restaurant's staff. The use of ""توفير"" in this context also suggests that the reviewer feels they were taken advantage of.

The reviewer concludes by advising others to ask directly for what they want from the restaurant, rather than relying on someone else (مباشرة من المطعم), which further emphasizes their negative experience and frustration with the service. Overall, the sentiment of the review is strongly negative due to the reviewer's disappointment and frustration with the poor service they received.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review expresses extreme dissatisfaction and frustration towards the application, using strong negative language such as ""فاااااشل"" (extremely bad), ""غشاشين"" (cheaters/scammers), and ""واستغلالييين"" (exploiters). The reviewer also states that they have not received any value from the service, citing issues with delivery and payment. The tone is aggressive and accusatory, implying that the application is unfair to its users.

The use of alliteration in the review, particularly in the phrase ""مادييين وغشاشين وواستغلالييين"" (middlemen cheaters exploiters), adds to the overall negative sentiment and creates a sense of urgency. The reviewer's emotional tone is also evident in their statement that they will no longer use the application, as they claim to have been exploited.

Furthermore, the review includes a sarcastic remark ""وبتاخدو رسوظ خدمе وضريبه مبيعات"" (they are taking advantage of our service and payment), which highlights the reviewer's perception of the application as exploitative. The phrase ""انتو وهي رح اشطب التطبيق"" (you will suffer, I will delete the application) reinforces this negative sentiment.

REASON:

The review ""تطبيق فاشل، يفتقر للأمانه 👍"" expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the application. The word ""فاشل"" (successful) is used to describe the app, but it is followed by the phrase ""يفتقر إلى الأمانة"", which translates to ""lacks security"". This suggests that despite its supposed success or performance, the app has a significant flaw - a lack of security.

REASON: The review ""سيء جدا وما في مصداقيه"" can be translated to ""It's very bad and it doesn't have any credibility."" The use of the phrase ""سيء جدا"" (it's very bad) sets a strong negative tone, implying that something is of extremely poor quality or unacceptable. Additionally, the inclusion of ""ما في مصداقيه"" (and it doesn't have any credibility), further emphasizes the reviewer's lack of trust in the subject being referred to.

In Arabic culture, ""سيء"" (bad) can also carry a sense of moral failing or flaw, which is reinforced by the use of the adjective ""جدا"" (very). This implies not only that something is of poor quality but also that it may be considered shameful or unacceptable.

The review does not convey any enthusiasm, dissatisfaction, or surprise, which are all emotions that would typically be associated with positive or negative reviews.

4404,كل شوية يقفل لوحده,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON:

The review ""كل شوية يقفل لوحده"" can be translated to English as ""A little while ago, he left alone."" The sentence structure and vocabulary used suggest a neutral or even slightly negative tone.

In Arabic, the word ""شوية"" (a little) is often used with a hint of irony or sarcasm when preceded by a verb like ""تقلف"" (to leave), implying that someone might not be leaving willingly. This subtle undertone suggests that the speaker might be implying that the person left due to some reason, such as being abandoned or rejected.

Furthermore, the use of ""لوحده"" (alone) emphasizes the solitary nature of the departure, which could imply a sense of isolation or loneliness. However, this does not necessarily carry a strong negative connotation by itself.

Overall, while there might be a hint of disappointment or frustration underlying the review, the tone is more observational and factual than overtly negative. Hence, I have classified the sentiment as neutral, as it neither strongly expresses praise nor criticism.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

The review ""بخزي🤮 طلبات🤮"" consists of two Arabic words, where both ""بخزي"" and ""طلبات"" are used to convey a negative sentiment.

REASON: The review ""سيارات الموظفين"" (which translates to ""office cars"" or ""company vehicles"") is a neutral phrase that does not convey a clear sentiment of positivity, negativity, or criticism.

4417,حرام عليكم تضحكو على الشباب وتستغلو قدراتهم ومجهودهم وبالاخر تقولو الهم مالكو اشي لاكن عند الله مابروح حق,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review appears to be a criticism or rebuke directed towards individuals who are taking unnecessary risks (tadhku) on young people, exploiting their abilities and efforts. The language used is strong and confrontational.

The phrase ""حرام عليكم"" translates to ""it's forbidden upon you"" and is often used in an authoritative tone to scold someone for their actions. This indicates that the reviewer feels strongly disapproving of those responsible for this exploitation.

Furthermore, the phrase ""تستغلو قدراتهم ومجهودهم"" means that they are taking advantage of young people's abilities and efforts. The word ""ستغلو"" is a stronger term than ""يتغلب"" or ""يؤثر"", which implies a more severe accusation against those in question.

The reviewer also uses the phrase ""الهم مالكو اشي"" to describe these individuals, which can be interpreted as accusing them of being materialistic and selfish. However, this interpretation might not align with their intended meaning, given that they use the word ""اشي"" (things) rather than ""شئ"" (a thing), which implies that the focus is on the things or assets being taken advantage of.

The reviewer concludes by saying ""انها عند الله مابروح حق"", which roughly translates to ""but in God's sight, there is no going back"". This sentence can be seen as a warning to those responsible for exploiting young people, implying that their actions will not go unnoticed and may have consequences in the afterlife.

This implies dissatisfaction with the value they received for their money, leading to a negative overall sentiment.","['The review is written in Arabic', 'but I can translate it to English for you.\n\nThe translation of the review is: ""Unfortunately', 'the prices are much higher than the restaurant.""\n\nSo', 'the specific issue mentioned is:\n\nHigher-than-expected prices.']","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following positive aspect:\n\nThe food quality is not mentioned as a negative point', ""implying it's acceptable or good enough.\n\nAdditionally"", 'the reviewer seems to appreciate the value for money', 'suggesting that they feel the price is reasonable compared to similar restaurants.\n\nNo specific positive aspects are directly stated in the review.']","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted a suggestion from the customer:\n\nThe prices are more expensive than expected.\n\nTranslated to English', 'this is: Prices are too high compared to the usual price of similar restaurants.']"

REASON: The review ""طتبيق سيء قد ارسلي منتجي مسكوبا"" is negative because of the word ""طبق"" which translates to ""coat"" or ""layer"", but in this context, it implies a layer of incompetence or ineptitude. 

The prefix ""طَبِق"" also carries a connotation of something being applied or forced upon someone, implying that the product's quality is somehow artificially imposed on the consumer.

In this review, the reviewer states that they received a product from the manufacturer (المنتجي) but it turned out to be defective or poor-quality (سِيء). The word ""مسكوبا"" means something that has been molded or shaped into a particular form, which in this case suggests that the product's quality was artificially imposed on the consumer.

Therefore, the negative sentiment in this review is directed towards the product itself and the manufacturer's perceived lack of quality control or competence.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

The review expresses a negative sentiment towards the service, specifically highlighting two main issues. The reviewer starts by stating ""حتى نجمة"" which translates to ""as far as stars are concerned,"" indicating that they are focusing on the low rating given to the service. This sets a tone for the rest of the review.

The first issue mentioned is the lack of free shipping (""بضحكو على بالتوصيل المجاني""), which implies that the reviewer was expecting this service but did not receive it. The word ""ضحكو"" can be translated to ""I got upset"" or ""I was disappointed,"" indicating a sense of frustration.

The second issue is the high tax rate (""بزيدو الضرائب"") without any apparent explanation, leading to an additional expense for the customer. The reviewer then states that they had to pay an extra amount from their visa balance (""بدون ما يتأكد الطلب""), which implies that the tax was unexpected and unexplained.

The final part of the review is a tongue-in-cheek comment ("" 🙂"") suggesting that if the service's shipping and tax issues were resolved, the reviewer might reevaluate their rating. However, given the context of the review, it seems unlikely that the reviewer would suddenly change their opinion without any significant improvements.

Overall, the negative sentiment in this review stems from the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the lack of free shipping and the high, unexplained tax rate, which led to an additional expense for them.","['Here are the extracted issues translated to English:\n\nProblems with free delivery', 'high taxes (without justification)', 'and not being paid on visa payments.\n\nNote: The review appears to be expressing frustration with a service or transaction', ""but it's difficult to pinpoint specific problems without more context.""]","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following positive aspects:\n\nFree delivery', ""Please note that the mention of 'سحبو من الفيزا' (paid to withdraw from Visa) could be seen as a negative aspect depending on context; however"", ""it's likely being used here in an idiomatic expression and means they got paid back by their bank.""]","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following suggestion:\n\nFree delivery and tax exemptions are great', 'but the hassle of having to pay VAT without a refund is frustrating.\n\nTranslated to English', 'the suggestion can be listed as: Free delivery', 'free tax exemptions', 'and a VAT refund process.']"
4446,للاسف الربح المادي يبدو أنه المتحكم الوحيد بالشركات... ومن باب أولى كسب الموظفين,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review expresses a negative sentiment towards the concept of profit and its dominance over societal interests. The phrase ""للاسف الربح المادي"" translates to ""Unfortunately, material gain seems to be the only ruler of companies..."" which sets a pessimistic tone.

The use of the word ""لبن"" (الربح), meaning ""profit,"" is also noteworthy. In Arabic culture, ""الربح"" has connotations of spiritual or moral gain, rather than just financial success. The reviewer's emphasis on ""الربح المادي"" as the only ruler suggests that they perceive profit as a sole motivator for companies, neglecting other important values such as social responsibility or employee welfare.

The phrase ""من باب أولى كسب الموظفين"" (""as an initial consideration to benefit employees"") appears to be an afterthought, implying that profit is not even a genuine concern for the company, but rather an external factor. This reinforces the reviewer's negative opinion of profit's dominance over other values.

Overall, the review expresses disappointment and disillusionment with the prioritization of material gain in companies, suggesting that it has negative social implications.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review ""تطبيق زبااااالة ونصابين"" contains a strong negative sentiment towards the app. The use of the Arabic word ""زبااااالة"" is an intensification of the word ""زبالة"", which means ""filth"" or ""uncleanliness"". This suggests that the reviewer found the app to be unclean, filthy, or lacking in cleanliness.

Furthermore, the addition of the suffix ""-نصابين"" implies a strong negative emotion, similar to saying ""and filth"" or ""and dirt"". This reinforces the idea that the reviewer had a strongly negative opinion about the app's quality or usability.

In essence, the review suggests that the app was considered unclean or lacking in cleanliness, which is a severe criticism. The use of Arabic words and grammar adds a layer of cultural nuance to the sentiment, but the overall message remains clear: the app was deemed unacceptable by the reviewer.

REASON:

The review ""غير منصفه واسعار غير حقيقيه"" can be translated to English as ""unfair prices and untrue prices."" In the context of Arabic culture, particularly among those familiar with Arabic language and customs, this phrase conveys a strong negative sentiment.

The word ""غير"" means ""not"" or ""un-,"" which implies a sense of injustice or unfairness. This is reinforced by the use of the adjective ""منصفه"" to describe the prices, further emphasizing that something is not right or just.

Furthermore, the phrase ""سعار غير حقيقيه"" suggests that the prices are misleading or deceptive. The word ""حقيقيه"" (true) implies a sense of authenticity and trustworthiness, which is being undermined by the prices being described as untrue.

In Arabic culture, fairness and honesty are highly valued, and expressing something as ""غير منصفه"" and ""سعار غير حقيقيه"" indicates that the reviewer perceives something as unfair or deceitful. Therefore, this review can be classified as negative due to its critical tone towards the prices being offered.

The word ""غير"" means ""not"" or ""un-,"" which implies a sense of injustice or unfairness. This is reinforced by the use of the adjective ""منصفه"" to describe the prices, further emphasizing that something is not right or just.

Furthermore, the phrase ""سعار غير حقيقيه"" suggests that the prices are misleading or deceptive. The word ""حقيقيه"" (true) implies a sense of authenticity and trustworthiness, which is being undermined by the prices being described as untrue.

In Arabic culture, fairness and honesty are highly valued, and expressing something as ""غير منصفه"" and ""سعار غير حقيقيه"" indicates that the reviewer perceives something as unfair or deceitful. Therefore, this review can be classified as negative due to its critical tone towards the prices being offered.

Note: The use of Arabic language in this review implies that the original context might be specific to a regional market or cultural setting, where the concept of fairness and pricing is deeply ingrained.","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following issue:\n\nLack of specificity and unrealistic prices.\n\nThese words are commonly used in Arabic reviews to express dissatisfaction with a product or service. \n\nNote: The word ""غير منصفه"" (ghair munṣifah) means ""lacking specificity"" or ""not clear""', 'while ""أسعار غير حقيقيه"" (as-sa\'ir ghayr haqīyah) means ""unrealistic prices"".']",[],"['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted a suggestion:\n\nUnfair price', 'untrue price.\n\nTranslated to English', 'it suggests that the customer believes they are being charged an unfair or untrue price.\n\nAdditionally', 'the review contains an Arabic word ""غير"" which can be translated to ""not"" in English.

4470,نصبه ع الموظفين الي بيشتغله معهم قاطعوهم,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review ""نصبه ع الموظفين الي بيشتغله معهم قاطعوهم"" can be translated to English as ""He appointed them, who will work with him"". However, the tone of this sentence is quite critical and accusatory.

In Arabic culture, the phrase ""ع الموظفين"" (with the employees) implies that someone has been entrusted with a responsibility or position by his colleagues or peers. The use of the word ""قاطعوهم"" (who will work with him) suggests that these individuals are not trustworthy or capable, and therefore, the speaker is implying that they were only appointed due to their ability to get along with the person who is being referred to.

The negative sentiment in this review arises from the fact that the reviewer seems to imply that the person was only given an opportunity because of the favoritism shown by his colleagues, rather than any actual merit or qualification. This suggests a sense of unfairness and resentment towards the appointment process.

Furthermore, the use of the word ""قاطعوهم"" also implies a sense of condescension and patronage, which adds to the overall negative tone of the review. Overall, the sentiment expressed in this review is one of disapproval and disappointment with the way someone was appointed to a position.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review is written in Arabic, but the sentiment and meaning can be understood by an Arabic expert. The phrase ""لماذا تم استغلال الموظفين لديكم وعدم الايفاء في وعدكم اتجاهم"" translates to ""Why did you exploit your employees and not fulfill your promises?"".

The tone of the review is critical and confrontational, with a strong sense of disappointment and betrayal. The use of the word ""استغلال"" (exploit) carries a negative connotation, implying that the reviewer feels the employer took advantage of their employees for personal gain. The phrase ""عدم الإفاء في وعدكم"" (not fulfilling promises) suggests a breach of trust and a failure to live up to expectations.

The question at the end of the sentence is rhetorical, implying that the reviewer is not asking why this happened, but rather accusing the employer of doing so.

REASON:

The review expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the application's actions.

The review expresses a strong sense of distrust and dissatisfaction towards the company, ""شركه نصابه"" (Nasabe), which translates to ""Installation Company"". The reviewer's tone is critical and accuses the company of engaging in deceptive practices.

REASON:

The review ""أعطوا الناس حقوقها بلاش ربنا يسخطكوا"" is a complex statement that conveys a sense of frustration and discontent, but also implies a desire for justice. The sentence can be broken down into two parts: ""اعطوا الناس حقوقها"" which means ""give people their rights,"" and ""بلاش ربنا يسخطكوا"" which translates to ""but why do they curse you?""

The speaker appears to be expressing frustration that despite the efforts to give people their rightful place, others are still being treated unfairly. The phrase ""ربنا"" is an Arabic word for ""Lord"" or ""God,"" and in this context, it might be used as a rhetorical device to emphasize the perceived injustice.

4492,تجربة سيئة تم الحدف,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON: The review ""تجربة سيئة تم الحدف"" can be translated to English as ""Bad experience aimed at"". In this context, the use of the word ""سيئة"" (seiaa) conveys a strong negative meaning, which implies that something unpleasant or undesirable occurred.

The phrase ""تم الحدف"" suggests that the experience was intentionally caused or planned, which reinforces the idea that it was not an accident or an unfortunate event. The overall tone of the review is one of disappointment and dissatisfaction, implying that the reviewer had a poor experience at the destination (the place where the review is about).

Furthermore, the use of the definite article ""ال"" before ""تجربة"" emphasizes that the review is specifically about a bad experience, rather than just a negative overall impression. This suggests that the reviewer had a clear and distinctively unpleasant experience that they want to convey.

In Arabic culture, where hospitality and respect for guests are highly valued, a ""tjrbah siiaa"" (bad experience) would be considered a serious offense, implying a lack of effort or disregard from the host. Therefore, the sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly negative, indicating a strong disappointment with the destination.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON: The review appears to be a quote from the Quran, specifically the phrase ""يا أيها الذين آمنوا أوفوا بالعقود"" (O ye who believe! Keep your promise). As an Arabic expert, I can analyze the context and meaning of this verse.

In Islamic tradition, this verse is often used to emphasize the importance of keeping one's word and fulfilling commitments. The phrase ""اوفوا"" (AOFWA) means ""fulfill"" or ""keep"", and is used in the imperative mood to address believers. However, without any additional context or surrounding verses, it is difficult to determine whether this review is praising or criticizing something.

In Arabic culture, quotes from the Quran are often used as blessings or prayers, rather than direct criticism. Therefore, I would argue that this review is not expressing a strong sentiment of either positivity or negativity. Instead, it may be simply acknowledging the importance of keeping promises, without any specific application to a particular situation or topic.

Without more context or information about what this verse is being reviewed in relation to (e.g. a product, service, or event), it is challenging to provide a more detailed analysis.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON:

The given review, ""حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل,"" is a common Arabic phrase that roughly translates to ""By the power of God, we are well."" However, when analyzing the sentiment, it's clear that this phrase doesn't convey a specific opinion or emotion.

In Arabic culture, phrases like this are often used as expressions of gratitude, relief, or acknowledgment. They can be part of daily conversations, and their tone is generally neutral. The phrase itself doesn't express happiness, sadness, or any other strong emotions.

The review is written in Arabic, but considering the context and the phrase used, it can be inferred that the reviewer is expressing strong disapproval or even condemnation towards a specific action taken by management (likely related to the employment of employees in Jordan).

4516,حقوق الانسان تظلم في هذه الشركة,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON: The review is written in Arabic, but understanding the context and the language used allows us to infer its meaning. The phrase ""حقوق الانسان تظلم في هذه الشركة"" translates to ""Human rights are being violated in this company"". This sentence conveys a strong negative sentiment towards the company.

In English, the word ""تظلم"" means ""are being tortured"" or ""are being mistreated"", which implies that the reviewer believes the company is treating its employees unfairly. The use of the definite article ""النسبة"" before ""حقوق الانسان"" emphasizes that human rights are being specifically violated, rather than just any rights.

Furthermore, the phrase suggests that there is a sense of injustice or wrongdoing happening within the company, which further reinforces the negative sentiment.

Overall, the review expresses a strong feeling of outrage and discontent towards the company's treatment of its employees, leading to the classification as negative.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review ""#مقاطعةطلبات"" appears to be an Arabic phrase that roughly translates to ""#Rejecting Requests"". However, without any additional context, it's challenging to determine the sentiment of the reviewer.

In Arabic culture, the number 8 is considered lucky and auspicious. In this case, however, the number 8 might not hold significant sentimental value in the review.

That being said, if we analyze the phrase ""#مقاطعةطلبات"", we can infer that it's more likely to be a neutral or even positive sentiment, as it seems to convey an action of fulfilling or honoring obligations. The word ""#مقاطعة"" typically means ""to respect"" or ""to follow,"" and ""#طلبات"" implies requests or demands.

REASON:

The review expresses a neutral sentiment towards Mavihi, an Arabic retail chain. The reviewer starts by mentioning that the company is good to its employees (""شركة مافيها خير لموظفيها ..""), which suggests a positive aspect of the company's culture or policies.

However, immediately after this statement, the reviewer adds a seemingly contradictory and negative phrase: ""ما فيها خير للناس"" (""what it has for people""). The wordplay on ""خير"" (khair) is crucial here. In Arabic, ""خير"" can mean both ""good"" and ""useful"" or ""profitable."" In this context, the reviewer uses the phrase to imply that Mavihi's offerings or business practices are not beneficial for people.

The net effect of this review is neutral because it highlights a mixed aspect of Mavihi's corporate culture: on one hand, they treat their employees well; on the other hand, they do not seem to be contributing positively to society. This balanced assessment neither strongly endorses nor condemns Mavihi, making the overall sentiment neutral.

In this context, the review is likely suggesting that someone is taking a moment to consider or inspect the actions or behavior of employees. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine whether this sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The lack of emotional language or evaluative adjectives makes it challenging to classify as anything other than neutral.

The review ""تطبيق استغلالي جدا وسيء"" can be translated to ""the app is very exploitative and bad"". The use of the word ""استغلالي"" (istğālī) implies that the app is taking advantage or exploiting its users, which carries a strongly negative connotation.

In Arabic culture, there is a strong emphasis on fairness, justice, and protecting one's rights. The word ""سيء"" (siyā`) means ""bad"", but in this context, it reinforces the idea that the app is not only bad but also morally reprehensible because of its exploitative nature.

The tone of the review suggests that the user has experienced significant issues with the app and feels that it is taking unfair advantage of them. The use of the word ""جدا"" (jadda) to describe the level of exploitation emphasizes the severity of the issue, implying that the app's behavior is not only problematic but also excessive.

REASON: The review ""رجعوا حقوق الموظفين"" translates to ""return employees' rights"". In the context of Arabic culture and societal expectations, this phrase has a strong negative connotation. It implies that someone or something has wronged or betrayed the trust of employees in some way.

In a typical work environment, employees have certain expectations and benefits provided by their employer, such as fair compensation, safe working conditions, and respect for their rights and dignity. The idea of having these rights ""returned"" suggests that they were somehow taken away or violated.

Given this context, the sentiment of the review is negative, implying a sense of betrayal, injustice, or failure on the part of the employer. It is unlikely that an employer would intentionally try to undermine employees' rights, so the tone is likely one of disappointment, frustration, or anger from someone who feels wronged by their employer.

In general Arabic culture, respect for employees and their rights is highly valued, and any perceived slight or betrayal can be seen as a serious matter. Therefore, the classification of this review as negative is accurate.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

The emoji could be interpreted as a neutral expression of ""I like"" or ""it's okay,"" which makes the classification as NEUTRAL more suitable.

It's also worth noting that in Arabic culture, the heart emoji might be used in a way that conveys affection or fondness without necessarily implying strong emotions, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific sentiment. Therefore, a neutral classification is the most accurate representation of this review.",[],"['The review contains a single emoji', 'which is a heart (❤️).

REASON:

The review expresses a strongly negative sentiment towards the application, and this classification is due to several key phrases and words that convey the reviewer's dissatisfaction.

Firstly, the use of the word ""تطبيق سيء"" (application bad) immediately indicates the reviewer's unfavorable opinion of the software. The term ""سيء"" has a strong negative connotation in Arabic, implying something is defective or problematic.

Furthermore, the reviewer mentions using the application but then expresses regret over this decision (""حذفته""), suggesting that they are disappointed with their choice. This phrase implies that the reviewer had hoped for better results from the application but was let down instead.

The mention of ""مظلومين"" (oppressed individuals) is also noteworthy. In this context, the word ""مظلوم"" means someone who has been wronged or mistreated. The inclusion of this term suggests that the reviewer believes the application failed to address a serious issue, namely the rights of employees who have been unfairly treated in relation to owning cars.

Finally, the phrase ""لا أنصح به"" (do not recommend) reinforces the negative sentiment of the review. This phrase is direct and explicit, clearly communicating the reviewer's disapproval of the application.

Overall, the combination of these phrases and words creates a strongly negative sentiment towards the application, which justifies the classification as Negative.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review expresses a very negative sentiment towards the customer service provided by the company. The reviewer starts by stating that their experience with the company's customers is "" فوق السيئة"" (worse than bad), implying that they have had extremely poor interactions in the past.

The reviewer then describes a recent interaction with the company, where they requested a specific product and received an opened container of milk instead. This incident was not just a mistake, but the reviewer felt that it was a deliberate attempt by the company to deceive them, as they claim the product was supposed to be closed. The reviewer also mentions that when they spoke to someone from the company, they were told that the product would be replaced, but this did not happen.

The reviewer also expresses frustration with the company's handling of customer complaints, stating that they are not willing to help customers who are unhappy with their products or service. They mention that if a customer complains about an issue, the company will often try to resolve it by sending someone to deliver a replacement product, but this can lead to delays and inconvenience.

Furthermore, the reviewer criticizes the company's handling of internal issues, stating that they are not transparent with customers about their problems or solutions. They also mention that the company's representatives do not communicate effectively, leading to misunderstandings and frustration for customers.

Overall, the review is extremely negative, highlighting a range of problems with the company's customer service, including poor communication, lack of transparency, and a tendency to deceive customers.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

In Arabic culture, using the word ""افضل"" (afdal) to describe something is a common way to express admiration or approval. This word carries a strong connotation of excellence and superiority.

The tone is critical and disapproving, implying that the reviewer is unhappy with the way the company treated its employees. The use of the word ""haq"" (rights) emphasizes the sense of injustice and entitlement, adding to the negative sentiment.

In this context, the reviewer mentions that after three years, a feature (the ability to laugh at young people) has been removed from the app (""ضحك على الشباب""). This implies that the removal of this feature was sudden and unexpected, as indicated by the phrase ""بعد ثلاث سنوات"" which means ""after three years"".

4552,"نصرة لسائقي طلبات ، توعدو السائقين بسيارات وتخلفو .",-1,talbat,POSITIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON: This review expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the taxi drivers, despite mentioning that it supports customers (طلبات). The phrase ""نصرة لسائقي طلبات"" can be translated to ""protection for customers,"" which might initially suggest a positive tone. However, when analyzed in the context of the rest of the sentence, it becomes clear that this phrase is being used ironically.

The reviewer then lists several complaints about the taxi drivers, including:

* ""توعدو السائقين"" (they promise you), implying that the drivers make false promises to attract customers.
* ""بسيارات"" (cars), which suggests that the drivers are either dirty or unclean.
* ""تخلفو"" (you delay), indicating that the drivers are late or unreliable.

These complaints collectively paint a picture of an unsatisfactory experience with the taxi drivers. The use of the negative phrase ""نصرة لسائقي طلبات"" at the beginning of the review is meant to be sarcastic, implying that the reviewers are not actually being protected by these drivers, but rather have a poor experience.

In Arabic culture, the concept of ""mصداقية"" (credibility) is highly valued, as it reflects an individual's trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity. When someone loses credibility, they are seen as untrustworthy or unreliable.

The reviewer's statement implies that the company has failed to earn their trust or confidence, likely due to some perceived wrongdoing, poor performance, or lack of transparency. The tone is direct and assertive, with no room for nuance or ambiguity.

REASON: The review expresses strong dissatisfaction and anger towards the company's actions, particularly towards its employees. The reviewer criticizes the company for providing cars to drivers after 3 years of work, only to abandon them and close their line of communication when it's time to end their employment.

The use of the word ""تطبيق سيء"" (bad application) sets a negative tone from the start, implying that the company is acting in an unfair or malicious manner. The phrase ""عدو سائقينهم"" (against its drivers) further emphasizes the reviewer's sense of injustice and betrayal.

Furthermore, the sentence structure and vocabulary used convey a sense of frustration and helplessness. The use of the word ""أغلق مدير الشركة"" (the director of the company closed his line of communication) creates an image of sudden and abrupt abandonment, leaving the employees without recourse or support.

The reviewer's tone is also critical of the company's leadership and management, implying that they are responsible for this unfair treatment. The absence of any positive feedback or redeeming qualities in the review underscores the overall negative sentiment.

REASON:

The review expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the application. The user, who initially had confidence in the app, now feels deceived and betrayed.

In the review, the user states that they were ""كثير معتمده"" (very confident) in the app's reliability, implying that they trusted it to deliver on its promises. However, when the user mentions that the company has changed their approach by focusing on young people (""عليهم""), which includes a requirement for 3 years of service before receiving a car, the tone shifts dramatically.

The phrase ""ما اعطوهم السيارات"" (they didn't give them cars) is particularly telling, as it highlights the user's expectation that they would be rewarded for their loyalty. The fact that this expectation was not met, and that the company prioritized young people over long-term customers like the reviewer, has led to a strong sense of resentment and disappointment.

The final phrase ""لا رابح التطبيق من عندي"" (the app will no longer benefit me) further emphasizes the user's negative sentiment, indicating that their trust and loyalty have been lost. Overall, the review expresses frustration, betrayal, and a loss of faith in the company's values and priorities.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review ""مقاطعه"" appears to be a single word in Arabic, which may indicate that it's a proper noun or a place name. Given the context, I'm assuming it might be referring to a location or an event in the Arab world.

Without additional information about the specific ""مقاطعه"", it's challenging to provide a detailed sentiment analysis. However, considering that ""مقاطعه"" roughly translates to ""connection"" or ""link"" in English, and Arabic culture places great emphasis on hospitality and relationships, I'm leaning towards a neutral sentiment.

In this context, ""مقاطعه"" might imply a connection between people, events, or locations, which could be seen as positive, negative, or neutral depending on the specific circumstances. For example, if it refers to a new business connection, it might be viewed positively by some individuals. On the other hand, if it's associated with a negative event or person, the sentiment would likely shift towards negativity.

Without further context, I've classified the sentiment as neutral, suggesting that ""مقاطعه"" is simply presenting information without expressing a clear opinion or emotion.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

The review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing a strong sense of frustration and disappointment towards the reviewer's experience with an Arabic application. Here's a breakdown of the reasons behind this classification:

* The use of ""حصل مشكلة"" (a problem occurred) at the beginning of the review sets a negative tone from the start.
* The mention of the order being incomplete, with less quantity than ordered and a higher price than expected, indicates that the reviewer feels they have been misled or cheated in some way.

* The rhetorical question ""اطلب الاوردر تاني?!! ودي مش اول مره"" (Do you want to order again?! This isn't the first time!) conveys a sense of exasperation and distrust towards the application, implying that the reviewer has had similar negative experiences before.
* The use of emphatic language such as ""ودي مش اول مره"" (and this is not the first time) adds emphasis to the reviewer's frustration and disappointment.

REASON: The review ""برنامج نصاب وكذابين"" (meaning ""The Deceiver's Game"" in Arabic) is a critical assessment of the show. Although it doesn't explicitly mention any specific aspect or character, the title itself suggests that the reviewer views the program as a manipulative and deceptive experience.

In an Arabic context, where politeness and reserve are often prioritized, using the phrase ""برنامج نصاب وكذابين"" might be seen as blunt and confrontational. This could imply that the reviewer is strongly dissatisfied with the show, possibly due to its content, tone, or perceived manipulation of its audience.

This suggests that the reviewer considers the prices to be prohibitively costly, making it difficult for them to justify using the establishment's services.

4571,استغلاليون.,-1,talbat,POSITIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review ""استغلاليون"" is a short phrase in Arabic, which translates to ""They exploited me"" or ""They took advantage of me"". The use of the verb ""استغلت"" (astagalta), which means ""to take advantage of"", indicates that the reviewer feels wronged by someone. The negative sentiment of this review can be inferred from the context of exploitation and betrayal.

In Arabic culture, being exploited is considered a significant social injustice, and expressing such feelings is often associated with strong emotions like resentment, anger, or disappointment. Given the brevity and directness of the phrase ""استغلاليون"", it suggests that the reviewer feels a strong sense of hurt or betrayal, which classifies the sentiment as negative.

Furthermore, in many Arab cultures, using phrases that explicitly express negative emotions can be seen as a way to convey strong feelings without needing additional context. In this case, the brevity and directness of the phrase ""استغلاليون"" emphasize the reviewer's negative experience, making it clear that they do not have a positive sentiment towards the situation or individuals involved.

In this case, the brevity and directness of the phrase ""استغلاليون"" emphasize the reviewer's negative experience, making it clear that they do not have a positive sentiment towards the situation or individuals involved.

Therefore, based on the review text ""استغلاليون"", I would classify the sentiment as negative due to its explicit expression of exploitation and feelings of betrayal.","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following issue:\n\n""abuse of""\n\nHowever', 'without more context', 'it\'s difficult to pinpoint a specific issue.

REASON: The review expresses a mixed sentiment, leaning towards being neutral. At first glance, the reviewer describes the ""program"" (likely referring to an educational or training program) as ""رائع"" (great), which indicates a positive initial impression. However, when they mention that after the last update, it stopped working (""أصبح لا يعمل""), their tone shifts to a neutral observation rather than outright criticism.

The reviewer's use of the word ""لà"" (which implies something has changed or become different) and ""سابق"" (meaning before or previously), emphasizes the contrast between the program's original state and its current state. This subtle nuance highlights that the reviewer is not entirely satisfied with the program's functionality after the update.

While the reviewer does express disappointment, their statement remains neutral as it focuses on a specific issue (program no longer working) rather than an overall negative opinion about the program.

The review is written in Arabic, but it can be easily understood by an Arabic expert. The sentence structure and vocabulary used are formal and conversational at the same time.

The review expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the app. Here's a breakdown of the phrase:

""تطبيق لا يحمي العميل"" translates to ""the application does not protect the customer"". This implies that the reviewer believes the app failed to provide adequate protection or support for its users.

""يحمي نفسو"" means ""protects itself"", which is a clever play on words. It suggests that the app prioritizes its own interests over those of its customers, rather than providing them with any meaningful protection or benefits.

""وما المرونة في التعامل"" translates to ""and no flexibility in dealing"". This phrase implies that the app was inflexible and unresponsive to user needs or concerns.

The phrase as a whole can be translated to ""the application is useless because it only protects itself and has no flexibility"". The reviewer is essentially saying that the app failed to deliver on its promises and was more concerned with protecting its own interests than providing any value to its users.

However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the specific sentiment behind the word ""حرامية"".

Therefore, a neutral classification is the most appropriate choice for this review, as it acknowledges the ambiguity of the word ""حرامية"" without making an assumption about its intended meaning or sentiment.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON:

The review expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the service provider, specifically the delivery company. The reviewer mentions that they ordered multiple times consecutively, but their orders were delayed by 2-3 hours each time, with some even arriving cold and wrapped incorrectly.

The reviewer's tone is frustrated and exasperated, using colloquial Arabic phrases such as ""أواي"" (and?) to emphasize their disappointment. The use of the phrase ""خدمه سيئه"" (bad service) explicitly states their negative opinion about the company's service.

Additionally, the reviewer specifically criticizes the driver (often referred to as the ""كابتن"" or captain), stating that they are always late and that their mobile phone is often lost. The reviewer also mentions that they had to return to the restaurant multiple times to complain, which further emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the company's service.

The reviewer ends the review with a dismissive expression (""أوي"") and a emoji of frustration (🤦🏻‍♂️) and a somewhat sarcastic smiley face (:) , which reinforces their negative sentiment. Overall, the tone is overwhelmingly negative, indicating that the reviewer was extremely dissatisfied with their experience with this delivery company.

Note: The use of Arabic emojis and phrases may not be immediately recognizable to non-Arabic speakers. However, in context, they contribute to the reviewer's frustration and disappointment, further emphasizing the negative sentiment expressed in the review.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

The review ""موقع سيئ ما انصح حد فيه"" can be translated to English as ""The website is bad, I don't recommend it."" The sentiment of the review is negative because the reviewer explicitly states that they do not recommend the website.

In Arabic, the word ""سيئ"" (seiy) means ""bad"" or ""unpleasant"", and when used in this context, it implies a strong negative opinion about the website. Additionally, the phrase ""أنصح حد فيه"" (anshah haduhu fihi) means ""I don't recommend it to anyone"". The use of the negative imperative form ""أنصح"" (to advise or recommend) is also telling, as it implies that the reviewer does not feel comfortable vouching for the website.

Furthermore, the fact that the reviewer uses the phrase ""موقع سيئ"" suggests that they have had a poor experience with the website. In Arabic culture, it is customary to use polite language when expressing negative opinions, so the use of the word ""سيئ"" in this context implies a strong sense of disappointment and frustration.

Overall, the sentiment of the review is strongly negative, indicating that the reviewer has had a poor experience with the website and does not recommend it to others.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review consists of a sequence of Arabic characters, which may seem nonsensical at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the reviewer is using numerical values to represent a rating or score, as often seen in online reviews.

In this case, the numbers ""٢"" (2), ""ب"" (ba'), ""٢٣"" (23), ""ب٢"" (b2), and ""٥٥"" (55) can be interpreted as a coded representation of a numerical value.

The review contains a strong negative sentiment, which can be broken down into several components.

Firstly, the use of the phrase ""ليش بتضحكو"" implies surprise and frustration at being misled or deceived by someone. In this context, it seems that the reviewer has been duped into thinking that a certain person is responsible for something (the cars), but instead, they are not.

Secondly, the phrase ""اوهمتوهم"" reinforces this feeling of betrayal, suggesting that the person was intentionally misled or manipulated. The use of ""و"" also indicates a sense of confusion and disorientation.

Thirdly, the phrase ""إنه الهم سيارات"" is a sarcastic remark, implying that someone has been taking advantage of the reviewer's gullibility for personal gain (the ""سيارات"" being cars). This suggests that the reviewer feels they have been taken advantage of in some way.

Finally, the phrases ""لыш الحرمنه"" and ""نصب راح نعمل مقاطعة"" indicate a sense of outrage and determination to take action.

REASON:

The reviewer expresses a strong dissatisfaction with their experience using the application. They compare it unfavorably to another application they used in the past, citing the long wait time for ordering as a major issue (""بطول الطلب كثير""). The fact that they were unable to complete their order due to this issue and had to wait an additional hour for the waiter to bring them home after they had already arrived (""بلغي بوصلني على البيت بعد ساعة"") is particularly frustrating.

The reviewer also criticizes the customer service, stating that the staff demanded payment for the order despite the fact that it was not ready due to their own fault (""ودهد يدفعوني سعر الطلب""). Furthermore, they express frustration with the lack of consideration shown by the restaurant towards their situation (""وanna بكون لاغي بسبب عدم قبول طلب المطعم والبحث عن الساءقين الطويل جدأ""), implying that the staff was not willing to accommodate them.

The review expresses a strongly negative sentiment towards the application and the company. The language used is blunt and critical, with words like ""مقرف"" (meaning ""shameful"" or ""unacceptable"") and ""افشل"" (meaning ""failure""), which convey a sense of disappointment and frustration.

The reviewer also mentions specific grievances, such as poor customer service (""تعامل سيئ""), long wait times for orders (""أكثر من ٤٥ دقيقة""), and the inability to request more than one order in under an hour (""واکثر من ٤٥ دقيقة""). This level of detail suggests that the reviewer was not just dissatisfied with their experience, but also had concrete issues that they felt were not being addressed by the company.

In Arabic culture, the concept of ""خساره"" carries significant emotional weight, implying not only a tangible loss but also a sense of disappointment, frustration, or even shame. The use of this word suggests that the reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction or regret regarding something they experienced.

REASON: The review ""تاخيررررررر"" (which can be roughly translated to ""re repeated delay"") is written entirely in Arabic, and it appears to be a nonsensical string of characters. When analyzed from an emotional and contextual perspective, it's challenging to determine a specific sentiment.

However, if we consider the possibility that this review might be intended to convey frustration or disappointment with a product or service, one could argue that the repetition of ""تاخير"" (meaning ""delay"") in a somewhat exaggerated manner might suggest a strong negative emotion. Nevertheless, without further context, it's difficult to make an informed assessment.

Moreover, the use of alliteration and emphasis on the word ""تاخير"" could be interpreted as an ironic or sarcastic tone, rather than a genuine expression of frustration. In Arabic culture, repetition is often used for emphasis or rhetorical effect, so it's possible that this review is intended to convey a sense of exasperation rather than outright anger.

Ultimately, without more information about the context in which this review was written, it's difficult to assign a definitive sentiment. Therefore, I have classified the sentiment as neutral.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON:

The review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing frustration and disappointment towards a service. Here's a breakdown of the sentiment:

* The mention of an order being delayed by 1 and a quarter hours (ساعة وربع جalla) indicates that the reviewer experienced a significant delay, adding to their frustration.
* The words ""بطلبات غلط"" (with wrong orders) and ""حساب مختلف عن اللى ظاهر عندى"" (with a different account than what was shown to me) imply that there were errors in the order processing or accounting, which further aggravates the situation.
* The phrase ""الدعم مش بيرد"" (the support is not redemptive) suggests that the reviewer's attempts to resolve the issue with customer support were unsuccessful or unhelpful.
* The mention of ""لا فى حد بيسال ولا بيعبر"" (there is no one who is listening or responding) implies a lack of attention or responsiveness from the service, which adds to the overall sense of frustration and disappointment.
* Finally, the reviewer's exclamation ""انتو ولا على بالكم اى حاجة"" (you are burning people, what is the matter with you?) indicates extreme anger and frustration towards the service.

Throughout the review, the tone is aggressive and accusatory, with a strong emphasis on negative emotions. The language used is also quite forceful, which reinforces the negative sentiment of the review.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

The reviewer also states that their companion worked hard and completed tasks, implying a level of satisfaction. However, they express dissatisfaction with the outcome (""مش راضي"") after working on something (مصاري راحن اعملت تسجيل خروج من الحساب). The word ""مش"" is an intensifier that amplifies the negative sentiment.

The reviewer's tone also implies a sense of resignation or acceptance (""يرجع يفوت ع الحساب""), which suggests that they have resigned themselves to the situation rather than expressing strong emotions. Overall, while there are positive and negative aspects mentioned, the review leans towards neutrality due to its balanced and somewhat apathetic tone.

Additionally, in Arabic culture, neutral expressions are often used when describing everyday events or experiences without assigning a strong emotional value.

The reviewer's tone is critical and warning, advising others against using the app, which further supports the classification as negative.","['After understanding the review context as an Arabic expert', 'I extracted the following issues:\n\nHigh prices of food delivery services are significantly higher than those of traditional restaurants', 'do not recommend the application under any circumstances except for necessity.\n\nTranslated to English', 'the issues are:\nHigh prices of food delivery services are significantly higher than those of traditional restaurants', 'Do not recommend the application unless necessary.']","['After analyzing the review', 'I extracted the following positive aspect:\n\nOriginal text translation: ""أعراض الطلبات أقل عن أسعار المطاعم الأصلية بكثير""\n\nTranslated to English: ""Prices on the app are significantly lower than traditional restaurant prices.""\n\nNote that this is a single phrase and not necessarily a comprehensive assessment of the app. However', 'it suggests that one aspect of the app may be appealing due to its pricing.']",[]
4629,شركه حراميه حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل,-1,talbat,POSITIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: POSITIVE

REASON:

The review ""شركه حراميه حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل"" is written in Arabic, but as an Arabic expert, I can analyze the language and context to understand its meaning.

The phrase ""شركه حراميه"" can be translated to English as ""a company from hell"". However, when considering the entire sentence with the added phrases ""حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل"", we can see that it's not a literal criticism of a company. Instead, it's an expression of divine approval and support.

""Hassbi Allah"" means ""by God's will"" or ""in God's name"". It's a common Arabic phrase used to express gratitude or praise for something.

""نعم الوكيل"" can be translated to English as ""thankfully, the reliable one"". This part of the sentence emphasizes that someone is being supported and trusted by God.

In the context of this review, it seems that the reviewer is expressing admiration and appreciation for someone (likely a businessperson, organization, or individual) who has been considered ""from hell"" in some way. Instead of seeing them as negative, the reviewer sees them as someone who has been blessed with divine approval and support.

The use of superlatives like ""حراميه"" to describe someone is also worth noting. In Arabic culture, this phrase can have a strong connotation, implying that something or someone is exceptional, admirable, or even revered. Here, it's used in a way that emphasizes the reviewer's positive opinion and appreciation for the person or organization being described.

Overall, the sentiment of this review is one of admiration and gratitude, with the reviewer expressing their support and approval for the person or organization in question.","CLASSIFICATION: POSITIVE

REASON:

The review is written in Arabic, and upon analyzing it, I found that the sentiment expressed by the reviewer seems to be neutral. Although the reviewer mentions a specific issue with their package (""مشكله""), they do not express strong emotions such as anger or frustration.

Instead, the reviewer uses phrases like ""ما حدا يشتري من البطاقه"" (nothing is worth buying from the card) and ""تصلحوهاي المشكله"" (solve your problem), which suggest that the issue at hand can be resolved with a bit of effort. The tone is more matter-of-fact than angry or upset.

Additionally, the reviewer mentions their personal connection to the product (""موصي من ابو عمر"" and ""وصيت من تبع الهاشمي""), which suggests that they have a vested interest in resolving the issue but are not expressing anger or resentment towards the company.

The use of colloquial Arabic expressions like ""يا طلبات"" (oh, packages) also adds to the neutral tone, as it is a common and informal way to address issues rather than an aggressive one. Overall, the reviewer seems to be seeking help in resolving the issue rather than venting their frustration with the company.

It's worth noting that the review context appears to be related to a packaging service, where the reviewer had an issue with their package not being delivered correctly. However, the reviewer does not express strong emotions or demands, which suggests a neutral sentiment.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

4631,لم يتم تنفيذ الطلب وتأخر في الطلب,-1,talbat,NEGATIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review ""لم يتم تنفيذ الطلب وتأخر في الطلب"" can be broken down into two main phrases. The first phrase ""لم يتم تنفيذ الطلب"" translates to ""the request was not implemented."" This suggests that the reviewer's expectations or wishes were not met.

The second phrase ""تأخر في الطلب"" translates to ""delay in the request."" This implies that there was a delay in fulfilling the request, which adds to the negative sentiment of the review.

Overall, the combined effect of these two phrases creates a negative tone. The reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction and frustration with the fact that their request was not fulfilled on time, which indicates a poor experience or service.

In Arabic, the use of the phrase ""لم يتم"" (did not) to describe something that did not happen is a common way to express disappointment or regret. The repetition of this phrase in the review emphasizes the gravity of the situation and reinforces the negative sentiment.

The tone of the review is also somewhat formal, which suggests that it may be from a customer who is seeking to hold a business accountable for its failure to meet their expectations. This further supports the classification as a negative review.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the flight experience. The reviewer starts by acknowledging that the title is clear, implying that they had high expectations for the flight. However, despite the clarity of the title, the flight itself did not meet their expectations.

The reviewer states that the pilot did not show up, and this was particularly frustrating because they were aware that the pilot was ""merammī"" (a term that roughly translates to ""window seat"" or ""seat next to the window""). The fact that the pilot didn't show up must have made it difficult for the reviewer to enjoy their flight, especially since they had been looking forward to this experience.

The reviewer also mentions that the airline staff repeatedly asked them if everything was okay, implying that they were trying to make excuses or downplay the situation. The phrase ""ندمت انى قمت بهذه التجperience"" translates to ""I regret having experienced this,"" which suggests that the reviewer is deeply disappointed and frustrated with their experience.

Finally, the reviewer concludes by saying ""لا تطلبوا طلبات"" which can be roughly translated to ""Don't ask for requests."" This statement implies that the airline's staff were overbearing and made unreasonable demands on the reviewer during a time when they were already experiencing significant inconvenience.

Overall, the review expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the flight experience, citing a series of disappointments and frustrations with the airline's performance.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON: The sentiment of this review is negative because the reviewer expresses frustration and disappointment towards the new update of Kitia (a Arabic term, possibly referring to WhatsApp). 

The reviewer starts by saying ""اسخف تطبيق لكيتها"" which can be translated to ""the application was very poor"". This already sets a negative tone. They then mention that the new update is making it difficult for them to make calls or send messages with less than 5,000. The use of the word ""حد الادني"" (a very small amount) implies that they are unhappy with this limitation.

The reviewer then explicitly states their request to be allowed to have more free messages like other people who pay 1 million. They end by saying ""ولله اريد اطلب ما عندي"", which roughly translates to ""and I will ask for what is mine"".

Throughout the review, there is no positive sentiment or language used that would suggest a neutral or positive opinion about the new update of Kitia. The reviewer's tone is one of frustration and dissatisfaction with the current limitations imposed by the company, leading me to classify their sentiment as negative.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON: The reviewer has expressed a generally positive sentiment towards the application, stating that it is ""ممتاز"" (excellent). However, they also highlighted a significant drawback: the lack of functionality to enable payment via Visa/Mastercard. This criticism prevents the review from being entirely positive and instead leans towards neutrality.

The reviewer's use of the word ""إنقصة"" (short for ""ينقص"", meaning ""it lacks"") emphasizes the importance of this issue, suggesting that it is a significant flaw rather than just a minor annoyance. While the reviewer did not use overtly negative language, their criticism of the application's payment functionality outweighs their praise, resulting in a neutral classification.

It's worth noting that Arabic culture values honesty and directness in communication, so it's likely that the reviewer would want to express both their positive experience with the application and its shortcomings.

REASON:

This review expresses a strong sense of frustration and disappointment with the company, primarily due to issues related to payment processing. The reviewer explicitly advises against ordering from this company, citing several negative experiences.

The first point highlights the delay in receiving orders after payment, which is attributed to the company's withdrawal of funds from customers' accounts. This suggests that the company's system is flawed and prioritizes their own interests over customer satisfaction.

The second point emphasizes the insufficiency or presence of errors in orders due to the same issue with fund withdrawals. The reviewer feels that their concerns are not being addressed, as there is no reliable contact number for resolving issues related to faulty orders. Furthermore, if an error is discovered after payment and a refund is made via a prepaid card, customers only receive points worth 20-30 Dirhams (a relatively small amount), which cannot be redeemed or returned.

The reviewer's advice to order with ""cash on delivery"" (COD) when possible highlights their dissatisfaction with the company's payment system. By recommending COD, they are essentially suggesting that customers avoid using credit cards with this company due to the risk of delays and errors in processing payments.

Overall, the tone of the review is strongly negative, reflecting the reviewer's disappointment and frustration with their experiences with this company.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review ""خوه طريقه الدفع ليه اتغيرت"" can be broken down into a phrase that conveys a sense of frustration or disappointment. However, the overall tone is more neutral than negative.

In Arabic, the word ""طريقه"" (way/path) implies a change or alteration in something. The word ""دفع"" refers to payment. When combined with the phrase ""ليه اتغيرت"", which roughly translates to ""why has it changed?"", the sentence can be interpreted as asking about the reason for a recent change in the way payments are made.

The use of the question tag ""ليه"" (why) at the end of the sentence implies that the speaker is seeking information or clarification on the issue, rather than expressing strong emotions like anger or frustration. This indicates a more neutral and inquiring tone, suggesting that the reviewer is simply trying to understand what has changed without explicitly condemning it.

Furthermore, the use of the verb ""اتغيرت"" (changed) in the second person singular form (""طريقه"") creates a sense of direct address and inquiry, which further reinforces the neutral tone. The speaker appears to be asking about the change rather than making a statement about it, maintaining a level-headed and curious attitude.

Overall, while the review does express some curiosity and interest in understanding the change, its overall sentiment remains neutral due to the lack of strong emotional language or negative connotations.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON:

The review is written in Arabic, but I'll break down the sentiment based on the context and language used.

The phrase ""والله اذا التوصيل مجاني"" translates to ""God willing if delivery is free"". This suggests that the reviewer is expressing a negative opinion about the service or product being offered. The use of the word ""walah"" (God) at the beginning of the sentence implies a sense of surprise or frustration, and the phrase ""أذا التوصيل مجاني"" implies that something unexpected has happened.

The second part of the review, ""كلش زينن الي يشوف تعليقي انعل وجهك"", translates to ""Everyone who sees my response will laugh at you"". This sentence is a strong indication of contempt or disdain for someone or something. The use of the word ""كلش"" (laugh) and the phrase ""زينن الي يشوف تعليقي"" emphasizes that the reviewer believes others will find the product or service ridiculous, which reinforces the negative sentiment.

In Arabic culture, direct criticism or mocking can be seen as impolite or even rude. The reviewer's tone is likely meant to convey strong dissatisfaction with the product or service, but it's also possible that they're trying to express themselves in a way that's perceived as blunt or unfiltered due to cultural expectations of politeness.

Overall, the review expresses a strongly negative sentiment towards the product or service being offered.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON:

The review is written in Arabic, but I'll break down the sentiment based on the context and language used.

The phrase ""والله اذا التوصيل مجاني"" translates to ""God willing if delivery is free"". This suggests that the reviewer is expressing a negative opinion about the service or product being offered. The use of the word ""walah"" (God) at the beginning of the sentence implies a sense of surprise or frustration, and the phrase ""أذا التوصيل مجاني"" implies that something unexpected has happened.

REASON: The given review is a string of Arabic text that appears to be a mixture of poetic language and emotive expressions. When analyzed, the sentiment can be decoded as follows:

* The use of the phrase ""يا رب"" (يا رَب) which translates to ""Oh God"" or ""Oh Lord,"" often used to express gratitude, relief, or praise.
* The word ""فغ"" followed by an upside-down Arabic numeral """" indicating a numerical value of 5. However, this digit is written in reverse, suggesting that the reviewer might be expressing irony or joking about a particular issue related to five (e.g., five stars, issues with five people).
* The character representation of a smiley face (❤️) attached at the end of the review indicates strong affection or appreciation.
* When translated and broken down into English, this text essentially conveys a sentiment of relief or expression of gratitude in an unconventional way.

In light of these elements, it can be inferred that the reviewer's tone is positive. The use of Arabic poetic language to express feelings of relief, admiration, or happiness indicates that they are expressing gratitude towards something or someone.

REASON:

The review ""تطبيق سئ"" can be translated to English as ""the app is bad."" The word ""سئ"" has a negative connotation, implying dissatisfaction or disapproval.

In Arabic culture, the prefix ""سئ"" is used to express strong negation and dissatisfaction. It's similar to saying ""this app is terrible"" or ""I'm really disappointed with this app."" The tone is one of disappointment and frustration, indicating that the reviewer has a poor experience with the application.

The brevity of the review also contributes to its negative sentiment. The word ""سئ"" is short and direct, conveying a strong sense of dissatisfaction without needing further elaboration. This concise expression suggests that the reviewer had a severe or unfulfilling experience with the app, leading to a negative overall sentiment.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON: 

The review starts with the phrase ""بoglob ع المصري الحرامي"" which can be translated to ""good job, Egyptian criminal"". However, the tone of the sentence is not meant to be derogatory or insulting towards Egyptians. In Arabic culture, addressing someone by their nationality or background in a derogatory manner is often used as a rhetorical device to emphasize the point being made.

In this context, the phrase is likely being used to express admiration and appreciation for the individual's actions. The word ""عالمي"" (al-ummi) can also be interpreted as ""worldly"" or ""global"", which further emphasizes the idea of the person being a positive influence on a global scale.

The phrase then shifts to expressing support for protecting consumers, with the word ""حماية المستهلك"" meaning ""protection of the consumer"". This is a clear indication that the reviewer is advocating for fairness and justice in business practices, which is a commendable sentiment.

Finally, the phrase ""وايد عليكم زولو"" can be translated to ""and may you all be successful"" or ""and may your efforts be fruitful"". This closing sentence reinforces the positive tone of the review, suggesting that the reviewer wishes the person being addressed success in their endeavors.

Overall, the sentiment of this review is one of admiration and support for a global individual who is making a positive impact on consumers.

The review appears to be a message of forgiveness and gratitude, rather than a criticism or complaint. The phrase ""حسبي الله عليكم خصمتو من حسابي"" translates to ""My Lord has forgiven you from my account,"" which suggests that the speaker is expressing remorse for any wrongs they may have committed against others.

The mention of exchanging 5 dinars (a currency unit) as compensation for food implies a sense of generosity and goodwill. The fact that this exchange occurred without the speaker having to exert pressure or manipulation (""ما تواصلتو معي"") further emphasizes their willingness to make amends.

However, the phrase ""الله لا يسامحكم"" translates to ""God will not forgive you,"" which seems contradictory at first glance.

This review is classified as negative due to the overwhelming tone of frustration, disappointment, and anger expressed by the reviewer. The use of exclamation marks (!) adds emphasis to the emotions conveyed, making the text more intense.

The reviewer initially expresses a neutral or even positive sentiment towards the new application, stating that it was ""كنت لا اطلب الا عن طريقه"" (I only wanted its way). However, as they mention the latest policy change regarding service fees, their tone shifts dramatically. They express dismay and frustration, using rhetorical questions to highlight their concerns.

The reviewer criticizes the company for introducing a new fee structure that was not expected by users. They specifically point out that this new policy is contrary to previous practices, where users were charged a flat rate for delivery, ranging from 5 to 15 Egyptian pounds depending on the distance. The introduction of an additional service fee has increased the overall cost, making the reviewer feel misled.

Furthermore, the reviewer questions why the company did not adapt the existing fee structure instead of adding new fees. They also express disappointment with their previous bill, which was significantly higher than expected (175 Egyptian pounds) due to the additional service fee.

Throughout the review, the reviewer's language is characterized by strong emotions, including ""بكل اسف"" (with great sadness), indicating a negative sentiment towards the company's decision. The overall tone of the review is one of disappointment and frustration with the new policy change.","CLASSIFICATION: NEGATIVE

REASON: The review ""دايما يتم الغاء الطلب"" can be translated to English as ""Always the order is cancelled"". In Arabic, the phrase is often used to express a pattern of behavior or frustration with customer service.

However, when analyzed in the context of online reviews, it's more likely that this sentiment is being expressed as a complaint. The speaker may be frustrated with the frequency of cancelled orders or poor communication from the service provider.

The tone of the review is somewhat neutral because it doesn't contain any overtly emotional language or profanity. Instead, it uses a straightforward and factual description to convey the issue. However, the overall sentiment is still negative, as it implies that the speaker has experienced repeated problems with the service provider.

It's worth noting that in Arabic culture, being direct and blunt is often seen as a sign of honesty and respect. Therefore, even though the phrase may seem harsh on its face, it's actually a common way to express frustration or disappointment in everyday conversation.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

4707,ولا نجمه بستهل لانو. طلبت من مطقم نور الدين طلع بخزي مو. طلب ككامل حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل فيهم,-1,talbat,POSITIVE,high,"CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL

REASON: The review expresses a mix of emotions and sentiments, but ultimately concludes on a neutral tone. Here's a breakdown of the sentiment:

The reviewer starts by expressing dissatisfaction with the product, stating that there is no ""Najmeh"" (a popular Arabic perfume brand) in the bundle. This sets a negative tone for the beginning of the review.

However, the reviewer then shifts their focus to the customer service experience at the store called ""Matarq Noraddin"". They mention that the staff member's reaction to their request was embarrassing (""خزي مو""), which suggests a negative interaction with the staff.

Despite this, the reviewer then expresses gratitude and appreciation towards God for the ""Kamil Hossbi"" (a phrase commonly used in Arabic prayers) and mentions the phrase ""wa ne'm el wa kil"" (meaning ""and thank God and blessings""). This shows that the reviewer is trying to shift their focus from the negative interaction to a more positive and spiritual tone.

Ultimately, the review concludes on a neutral note, neither strongly endorsing nor criticizing the product or service. The reviewer seems to be expressing their disappointment with the experience without assigning blame or praise to either the product or the staff.

It's worth noting that in Arabic culture, it's common for customers to express gratitude and humility when interacting with shopkeepers or service providers, even if they're not entirely satisfied with the experience. This can sometimes make it challenging to discern the true sentiment of a review.","CLASSIFICATION: NEUTRAL
